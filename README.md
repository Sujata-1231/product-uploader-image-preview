## AI Tools Used

    ChatGPT 4.0

        Helped in suggesting better toast message placement (top-center) instead of an alert box.

        Assisted in refining the handleChange logic for combined image and input field handling.

        Suggested UI improvements for responsive layouts (mobile full-width buttons, desktop right-aligned).

    GitHub Copilot

        Assisted with auto-completing boilerplate code, speeding up the writing of React components and TypeScript types.

        Provided quick suggestions for Tailwind classes while styling the form and layout.

        Helped predict code patterns for form validation, reducing development time and typos.
    My Contribution vs Copilot:

While Copilot gave suggestions, I made sure to manually verify and modify the logic to match the challenge requirements.
Using Copilot helped me save around 20–25% of time, especially for boilerplate and common UI patterns, allowing me to focus more on layout, UX, and functionality.
